Peter Piper bought a pack of pickled pepper corn . Where is the pack of pickled pepper corn that Peter Piper bought . My Bonnie lies over the ocean . My Bonnie lies over the sea . My Bonnie lies over the ocean . Oh bring back my Bonnie to me . Betty bought a butter but the butter was bitter . Betty bought a better butter to make the bitter butter better .
